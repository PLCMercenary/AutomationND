#+TITLE: Quick History of Controls
#+REVEAL_HLEVEL: 1
#+reveal_root: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/reveal.js/3.0.0 

* Not brief.. Quick... We got better stuff to do

* Why does every PLC class have this section? 
** Its actually kind of important
The same goes for computer programming. 
#+ATTR_reveal :frag (roll-in)
-Without a decent understanding of the development of PLCs and controls
-Some of it seems pretty senseless

* Can anyone tell me the history of PLCs
-I bet most of you have heard it at least once

** Usually goes something like this
- 1967 GE Hydramatic wanted to reduce Commissioning time for new lines

#+REVEAL: split
- The computer has been around for a good while, Dick Morley is just the man to solve this

#+REVEAL: Split
- ole Dick pens the initial draft of what he invisions as the "Modicon" on new year eve of 1968

** the requirements for the system were 
#+ATTR_reveal :frag appear
 - A solid-state system that was flexible like a computer but priced competitively with a like kind relay logic system.
 - Easily maintained, and programmed in line with the already accepted relay ladder logic way of doing things.
 - It had to work in an industrial environment with all its dirt, moisture, electromagnetism and vibration.
 - It had to be modular in form to allow for easy exchange of components and expandability.

*Magically poof, the Modicon 184 and Ladder logic 

* Yall think thats how Im going to do this?
 - Nahh
#+caption: Nope

** Contols History is way more interesting 
#+ATTR_Reveal: :frag (fade-in) 
- Automatic Feedback Controls have been around for 2000+ years
- Earliest examples inclued water clock described by Vitruvius - whom attributed them Ktesibios (circa 270BC)
- Heron of Alexandria described and sketched a range of "Automata"

** The timeline
• Early Control: To 1900
• The Pre-Classical Period: 1900-1940
• The Classical Period: 1935-1960
• Modern Control: Post-1955

** One of the first "industrial controllers"
- early 1600 
- Cornelius Drebbel (1572-1663)
- Tempreature controler that used a U tube of mercury with a float that lifted a damper 
- Rene-Antoine Ferchault de Reamur started using these devices for incubators in 1710 
- got a higher hatch rate than in nature for the first time recorded

* No Im not actually walking you guys through that 
 I said quick didnt I?

** Things to take away
#+ATTR_reveal :frag fade-in 
1) People have been automating the world aroung them since the beginnning of time. 
#+ATTR_reveal :frag fade-in 
   We just do better, faster, slicker, and more like Mr Robot
#+REVEAL: split
2) Ladder Logic was not and has never been used because its easier to troubleshoot or for maintenance techs
#+ATTR_reveal :frag fade-in 
   a) Ladder logic was made a thing by GE for 2 reasons
#+ATTR_reveal :frag (appear)
   1. PAPER. they were already printing all of the engineering drawings and has a developed program for documentation
   2. Commissioning and Site Acceptance. The whole reason for the development was to cut development and commissioning costs
#+ATTR_reveal :frag roll-in 
       changing the way the engineering team was specifying the build packages and printing the documentation would have added costs
#+ATTR_reveal :frag roll-in 
3) Ladder, Like all programming languages is meant for 1 thing. Humans to read it. the PLC could care less
