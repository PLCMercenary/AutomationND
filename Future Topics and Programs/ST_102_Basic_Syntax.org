* Structured Text basic syntax

** What is it?
Structured Text is PLC programming language defined by PLCOpen in IEC 61131-3. The programming language is text-based, compared to the graphics-based ladder diagram or Function Block Diagram.

** PROGRAM / END_PROGRAM
Everything in between is your PLC program.

** All statements are divided by semicolons
- Structured Text consists of statements and semicolons to separate them.
  -The language is not case-sensitive
- Even though it is good practice to use upper- and lowercase for readability, itâ€™s not necessary.
  -Spaces have no function
- But they should be used for readability.
